# Pain Point Prioritization Improvements

## Overview
Updated both Product Hunt and Google Play Store scrapers to prioritize pain points (negative feedback) over positive feedback, as pain points reveal user frustrations and market opportunities.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Comment Prioritization
- **Before**: Comments were processed in random order
- **After**: Comments are now sorted by sentiment priority:
  1. **Negative comments first** (pain points - highest priority)
  2. Neutral comments second
  3. Positive comments last

### 2. Enhanced Sentiment Summary Structure
Added new fields to `sentiment_summary`:
- `pain_points`: Array of top 5 pain points with details
- `pain_point_categories`: Categorized pain points by theme
- `positive_feedback`: Top 2 positive highlights
- `neutral_feedback`: Top 2 neutral comments

### 3. Pain Point Categorization
Automatic categorization of pain points into themes:
- **Usability**: UI/UX issues, navigation problems
- **Performance**: Speed, crashes, loading issues
- **Features**: Missing functionality, feature requests
- **Pricing**: Cost concerns, billing problems
- **Support**: Customer service issues
- **Bugs**: Technical problems, errors

### 4. Google Play Store Specific Improvements
- **Rating-based prioritization**: Reviews with 1-2 stars are treated as pain points
- **Multi-sort approach**: Get both most relevant and newest reviews
- **Enhanced review fetching**: Increased from 5 to 10 reviews per app
- **Thumbs up consideration**: Factor in review helpfulness

### 5. Product Hunt Specific Improvements
- **Confidence-based sorting**: Higher confidence negative comments prioritized
- **Increased comment limit**: From 5 to 10 comments per product
- **Better comment extraction**: Improved HTML and JSON parsing

## Data Structure Example

```json
{
  "sentiment_summary": {
    "total_comments": 4,
    "negative_count": 2,
    "positive_count": 2,
    "pain_points": [
      {
        "text": "Billing issues every month...",
        "author": "User Name",
        "rating": 1,
        "confidence": 0.85,
        "thumbs_up": 13
      }
    ],
    "pain_point_categories": {
      "pricing": ["Billing issues every month..."],
      "usability": ["Timer doesn't work after update..."]
    },
    "positive_feedback": [
      {
        "text": "Great app for home workouts...",
        "author": "Happy User",
        "rating": 5,
        "confidence": 0.75
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Benefits for AI Analysis

1. **Pain Point Focus**: AI can immediately identify the most critical user problems
2. **Categorized Insights**: Pain points are grouped by theme for easier analysis
3. **Prioritized Data**: Most important feedback (pain points) appears first
4. **Rich Context**: Each pain point includes author, rating, and confidence scores
5. **Market Opportunities**: Negative feedback reveals gaps competitors haven't solved

Every post on explore turns into reel format, ads are endless, and I see more random content in my feed than friends' posts, even if they're starred. I can't wait until another app like this gets on the market so I can jump ship.",

My internet connection is fine and works great on everything else, but on Instagram can't even send a single dm in under 10 minutes. Horrible!!",

I choose mixed orientations, & somehow pictures come out cropped in nonsensical ways on my feed. Some are blurry, when they shouldn't be. Stories are a wild card. Some zoomed in, some not, and no matter what I do, they don't pop up in chronological order. Forced to fix it manually. WHAT IS GOING ON?",

I can only zoom out one, and if I select more than 1 photo, it unzooms all of them. It has never done this before. The comments and notifications are weird as well. They glitch out, and when I go to click on the notification in the app, it doesn't let me, or it takes multiple times for it to work and bring me to where I need to be. Hope they fix this soon.",

It is an absolute Game Changer.\n\nWhat I realized only after implementing it:\n- Implementation is so easy: All important numbers are already in ChartMogul - any other tool would need so much adaption time.\n- It makes the work of sales & success teams visible, highlighting multiple KPIs (i.e. not only revenue but also retention rates, trial to paid conversion, etc.) and highlighting customer cohorts (i.e. KPI differences between customers we engaged with vs. those we didn't engage with)\n- And most importantly, our team loves the simplicity and the power behind it.\n\nThank you for such a great product!",

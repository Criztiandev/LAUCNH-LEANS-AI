### Most Helpful Reviews:

**General Task (Beta)**:
> "Really like the first few minutes with GT. 4 Column view works really well for me as I get an overview of my tasks and their progress without moving much within the app.
In the few days to come I Will be actively using this for my daily work to see how far the features available help me but so far I am liking it."

**28 Tasks Later**:
> "It makes boring to do lists into something more fun and do-able"

**Superlist**:
> "I just got access to the beta. I spent 10 minutes with it. First impression: I'm in love.
It will show over a week of daily driving where the cracks might be, but so far the onboarding and the first few interactions are super promising. 
Kudos Superlist folks! 
(are you ex-wunderlist, ex-msft? A lot of the logic feels purported from msft todo...)"

**Enqo**:
> "Breaking app for those who want more than task manager. Really great feature with chat, never saw this before in such apps."

**Task Architect**:
> "I think this is 🔥🔥🔥!!! 1) Pascio puts out great content and I use many of his products & 2) Having something like this is perfect for me, at work and at home!"

  "reviewBody": "I've been using folk for a couple of months and I love it! It's super easy to use, just sync all of your contacts in folk and then create the workflows you need for yourself and your team. I used to use Notion for managing PR outreach, and I've switched to folk - I'm a big Notion fan but you can't beat a tool that was designed for contacts to manage contacts.",
